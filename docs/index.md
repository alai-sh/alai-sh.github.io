# alai

A fast package and environment manager for Ansible collections, heavily
inspired by [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). alai resolves the collections a
project needs, records the exact versions in a lock file, and installs them in
a fraction of the time `ansible-galaxy` takes.

<!-- Published by alai's docs build from alai-sh/alai's docs/assets/casts/: move these if those files move. -->

!!! warning "Preview"

    alai is in preview and its interface isn't stable yet. It's written with
    the help of AI coding tools, with a human arguing over every design
    decision; [the docs](https://docs.alai.sh/) say more.

## Getting started

Install alai with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/),
which puts the `alai` command on your `PATH`:

<!-- At the first PyPI release: `uv tool install alai-sh`, as in alai's docs. -->
```console
$ uv tool install https://github.com/alai-sh/alai/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz
```

An `alai.toml` marks the project, so create one beside your playbooks, add the
collections they use, then run Ansible with them:

```console
$ touch alai.toml
$ alai add ansible.posix 'community.general>=10,<12'
Resolved 2 collections in 522ms
Prepared 2 collections in 1.21s
Installed 2 collections in 41ms
 + ansible.posix==2.2.2
 + community.general==11.4.9
$ alai run ansible-playbook site.yml
```

Commit `alai.toml` and the `alai.lock` it writes, and anyone who clones the
project gets the same collections with `alai sync`.
